Multivariate Time Series Analysis ‚Äì [CASE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES; ZAMBIA]üìä

üìå Introdcution and Objectives of the Project.
This project aims to analyze the relationships between multiple macroeconomic variables‚Äîsuch as Inflation, Interest Rates, Exchange Rates, e.t.c., and their impact on inflation Market in Zambia. Using Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) techniques, we will identify how these factors interact over time and influence inflation.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Exploring and Understanding key macroeconomic variable (Six Indicators). 

Below are the simplified definition our what we will be working with, independent variables," the term "independent" refers to variables that are manipulated or controlled by the researcher, and their values do not depend on other variables in the study; while "dependent" refers to the variable that is measured and is expected to change based on the manipulation of the independent variable(s).

- Inflation_%: The percentage change in the price level of goods and services (dependent variable).

- IR_%: Interest rates set by the central bank (independent variable).

- Forex_K/USD: Exchange rate of the local currency (Kwacha) to the US dollar (independent variable).

- BoZ_Reserves_K: Foreign exchange reserves held by the Bank of Zambia (independent variable).

- Currency_In_Circulation: Amount of local currency in circulation (independent variable).

- Copper_US/Tonne: Price of copper per tonne in US dollars (independent variable).

- Maize_(K'/50Kg): Price of maize per 50 kg in Kwacha (independent variable).

We will ensure your data is clean, complete, and in a consistent format (e.g., monthly time series), Handle missing values (e.g., interpolation or removal) and Normalize or scale the data if necessary (e.g., if variables are in different units).
  
## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exloratory Data Analysis [EDA] and Formulate Hypotheses.

Unlike univariate analysis, this step involves analyzing relationships between multiple variables. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is useful by data scientists or analyst to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. One tool which will be useful to analyze this relation is to 

- Formulating General Hypotheses: 
Formulate hypotheses as a whole (i.e., testing the overall relationship between inflation and the other variables) rather than one-by-one, we will use Pearson correlation to assess the strength and direction of the linear relationships between inflation and each independent variable.

- Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): There is no significant linear relationship between inflation and the independent variable (œÅ = 0).

- Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ): There is a significant linear relationship between inflation and the independent variable (œÅ ‚â† 0).
  
## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Testing for stationarity and Unit Root.

Applying transformations if necessary e.g. (log differencing, differencing). To ensure accurate modeling, we must check whether our time-series data is stationary and whether the variables move together over time (cointegration).
  
### Estimate a Regression Model and Choosing Estimation Method:
A regression model is a statistical tool used to examine the relationship between a dependent variable (the outcome you want to explain, e.g., inflation) and one or more independent variables (the factors that may influence the outcome, e.g., interest rates, exchange rates, etc.). The goal is to quantify how changes in the independent variables affect the dependent variable.
  
## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Building a forecasting model. 

In particular Vector Autoregressive (VAR) to Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) model to predict future value, to do this we will use:

üîπ Vector Autoregression (VAR): Best for short-term forecasting of interdependent variables.

üîπ Vector Error Correction Model (VECM): Best for modeling long-term equilibrium relationships between macroeconomic indicators.

-Forex.
