Multivariate Time Series Analysis – Macroeconomic Data and Its Impact on Financial Institutions & Forex [CASE OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES]📊

📌 Introdcution and Objectives of the Project.
This project aims to analyze the relationships between multiple macroeconomic variables—such as Inflation, Interest Rates, Exchange Rates, and GDP Growth—to assess their impact on Financial Institutions and the Foreign Exchange (Forex) Market in Zambia. Using Vector Autoregression (VAR) and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) techniques, we will identify how these factors interact over time and influence financial stability.

1️⃣ Explore and visualize trends in a key macroeconomic variable (Five Indicators).
To understand financial market dynamics, we will analyze the following key indicators:

🔹 Inflation Rate (CPI): Affects interest rates, banking profitability, and loan defaults.

🔹 Interest Rates (BoZ Policy Rate): Determines borrowing costs and bank liquidity.

🔹 Exchange Rate (USD/ZMW): Impacts forex reserves, trade balances, and bank exposure.

🔹 GDP Growth Rate: Measures economic expansion or recession, influencing credit demand.
  
2️⃣ Time-series decomposition.

Unlike univariate decomposition, this step involves analyzing relationships between variables.

🔹 Trend Analysis: Does inflation affect interest rates over time?

🔹 Seasonality Analysis: Do forex fluctuations follow predictable patterns?
  
3️⃣ Testing for stationarity and Unit Root.

Applying transformations if necessary e.g. (log differencing, differencing). To ensure accurate modeling, we must check whether our time-series data is stationary and whether the variables move together over time (cointegration).
  
🔹 Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test: Checks for stationarity.
  
4️⃣ Building a forecasting model. 

In particular Vector Autoregressive (VAR) to Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) model to predict future value, to do this we will use:

🔹 Vector Autoregression (VAR): Best for short-term forecasting of interdependent variables.

🔹 Vector Error Correction Model (VECM): Best for modeling long-term equilibrium relationships between macroeconomic indicators.

5️⃣ Evaluate economic implications on:

-Banks and Microfinance Institution
-Forex.
